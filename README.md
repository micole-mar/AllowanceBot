# AllowanceBot
As a year 13 student, I built an allowance tracker to keep track of the clothing allowances of the three Ranui children (fictional family).  

This Python script is an application called "AllowanceBot" that helps manage allowances for a family with multiple children. Here's a short description of its key components and functionality:  
The script uses the tkinter library to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
It imports various libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, tkcalendar for date selection, and others for GUI and file operations.  
The main class, AllowanceBot, manages the overall application and contains methods for displaying different frames/pages.  
The application has four main pages: StartPage (for password entry and login), MenuPage (the main menu for selecting a child's account), ChildPage (for managing a child's allowance), and ResetPage (for resetting all account data).  
The MenuPage allows the selection of a child's account and checking for end-of-year bonuses.  
The ChildPage allows a child to spend money, record purchases, and view spending history.  
Data for each child's account is stored in separate text files in the "data" directory.  
The script manages child allowances, allows them to spend money, and even calculates end-of-year bonuses based on certain conditions. It provides a user-friendly interface for the family to manage their finances.  

Note: The script uses images and specific file paths, so it may require modifications to work in a different environment or with different image resources.

I received an Excellence grade for this project, and was awarded first in Digital Technologies.
